// what might be the solution in case if I wanted to store a phone number into  a variable, which data type would suit this scenario.
const MyPhoneNumber = String("9843018195");
console.log(MyPhoneNumber)

/*It would be better to store my phone number as string because the phone number does get changed
and it is stored as a constant so that no one can change the value of that Variable.*/
