//  Use the + unary operator in a string that contains the number '999' and add 1 to it and show the output on the console. Note: the output should be 1000


let MyNum_1;

MyNum_1 = '999'

// Using unary operation "++"

MyNum_1++ 
console.log(MyNum_1)
// It is same as writing MyNum_1 = MyNum_1 + 1 or MyNum_1 += 1
