// Declare two variables using let on the same line without terminating the line and store true value in both the variables and perform addition and show the result on the console and try to analyze the code.

let Var_1, Var_2;

Var_1 = true;
Var_2 = true;


console.log('The addition of the given values is : ',Num_1+Num_2)

/*
Output = 2,
After analyzing;
According to my theory, the codes undergo various transition to convert into machine codes and as computer only understands binary codes on the deepest level,
so in binary 1 means True and 0 means False, which can be expressed in boolean values.
Therefore, The output is 2.
